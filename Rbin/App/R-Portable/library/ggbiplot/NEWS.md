This is a modest upgrade to the initial release, adding a number of features.

- corrected small bugs in `ggbiplot() and `ggscreeplot()`
- `reflect()` now also reflects supplementary variables from `FactoMineR::PCA()`
- added support for `ade4::dudi.pca()`
- `ggbiplot()` gains an `axis.title` argument
- `ggscreeplot()` gains `color`, `shape`, `linetype` and `linewidth` arguments
- Added `get_SVD()` intended the simplify the interface to various PCA functions.
- Now use `get_SVD()` in `ggbiplot()` and `ggscreeplot()`
- Extend some examples, requiring Depends:ggplot2

## Version 0.6.0

- Use `geom_polygon()` rather than `geom_path()` for ellipses to allow them to be filled.
- Added `var.factor` argument to expand or reflect the variable vectors
- Moved points/labels code earlier so ellipses and variable vectors are not obscured
- Replaced internal calculation of ellipses with `stat_ellipse()`
- Now allow ellipses to be filled (`geom_polygon()`) or unfilled (`geom_path()`)
- Added hex logo
- Added iris example to README
- Removed Imports: dplyr, purrr as no longer needed

## Version 0.56
