<h2>Reads a CEP (Canoco) data file </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>read.cep</code> reads a file formatted with relaxed strict CEP format
used in Canoco software, among others.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
read.cep(file, positive=TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>file</code></td>
<td>
<p>File name (character variable). </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>positive</code></td>
<td>
<p>Only positive entries, like in community data.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Cornell Ecology Programs (CEP) introduced several data formats
designed for punched cards.  One of these was the &lsquo;condensed
strict&rsquo; format which was adopted by popular software DECORANA and
TWINSPAN. A relaxed variant of this format was later adopted in
Canoco software (ter Braak 1984). Function <code>read.cep</code> reads
legacy files written in this format.
</p>
<p>The condensed CEP and CANOCO formats have:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Two or three title cards, most importantly specifying the format
and the number of items per record.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Data in condensed format: First number on the line is the
site identifier (an integer), and it is followed by pairs
(&lsquo;couplets&rsquo;) of numbers identifying the species and its
abundance (an integer and a floating point number).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Species and site names, given in Fortran format <code>(10A8)</code>:
Ten names per line, eight columns for each.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>With option <code>positive = TRUE</code> the function removes all rows and
columns with zero or negative marginal sums.  In community data
with only positive entries, this removes empty sites and species.
If data entries can be negative, this ruins data, and such data sets
should be read in with option <code>positive = FALSE</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a data frame, where columns are species and rows are
sites. Column and row names are taken from the CEP file, and changed
into unique <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> names by <code><a href="../../base/html/make.names.html">make.names</a></code> after stripping the blanks.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Function <code>read.cep</code> used Fortran to read data in <span class="pkg">vegan</span>
2.4-5 and earlier, but Fortran I/O is no longer allowed in CRAN
packages, and the function was re-written in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>. The original
Fortran code was more robust, and there are several legacy data sets
that may fail with the current version, but could be read with the
previous Fortran version. CRAN package <span class="pkg">cepreader</span> makes
available the original Fortran-based code run in a separate
subprocess. The <span class="pkg">cepreader</span> package can also read &lsquo;free&rsquo;
and &lsquo;open&rsquo; Canoco formats that are not handled in this
function.
</p>
<p>The function is based on <code><a href="../../utils/help/read.fortran.html">read.fortran</a></code>. If the
<code>REAL</code> format defines a decimal part for species abundances
(such as <code>F5.1</code>), <code><a href="../../utils/help/read.fortran.html">read.fortran</a></code> divides the
input with the corresponding power of 10 even when the input data
had explicit decimal separator. With <code>F5.1</code>, 100 would become
10, and 0.1 become 0.01. Function <code>read.cep</code> tries to undo this
division, but you should check the scaling of results after reading
the data, and if necessary, multiply results to the original scale.
