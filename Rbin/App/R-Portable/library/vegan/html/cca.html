<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>Model formula, where the left hand side gives the
community data matrix, right hand side gives the constraining variables,
and conditioning variables can be given within a special function
<code>Condition</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame containing the variables on the right hand side
of the model formula.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p> Community data matrix. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Y</code></td>
<td>
<p> Constraining matrix, typically of environmental variables.
Can be missing. If this is a <code>data.frame</code>, it will be
expanded to a <code><a href="../../stats/html/model.matrix.html">model.matrix</a></code> where factors are
expanded to contrasts (&ldquo;dummy variables&rdquo;). It is better to
use <code>formula</code> instead of this argument, and some further
analyses only work when <code>formula</code> was used.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Z</code></td>
<td>
<p> Conditioning matrix, the effect of which is removed
(&ldquo;partialled out&rdquo;) before next step. Can be missing. If this is a
<code>data.frame</code>, it is expanded similarly as constraining
matrix.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>scale</code></td>
<td>
<p>Scale species to unit variance (like correlations).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>na.action</code></td>
<td>
<p>Handling of missing values in constraints or
conditions. The default (<code><a href="../../stats/html/na.fail.html">na.fail</a></code>) is to stop with
missing value. Choice <code><a href="../../stats/html/na.fail.html">na.omit</a></code> removes all rows with
missing values. Choice <code><a href="../../stats/html/na.fail.html">na.exclude</a></code> keeps all
observations but gives <code>NA</code> for results that cannot be
calculated. The WA scores of rows may be found also for missing
values in constraints. Missing values are never allowed in
dependent community data. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>subset</code></td>
<td>
<p>Subset of data rows. This can be a logical vector which
is <code>TRUE</code> for kept observations, or a logical expression which
can contain variables in the working environment, <code>data</code> or
species names of the community data.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Other arguments for <code>print</code> or <code>plot</code> functions
(ignored in other functions).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Since their introduction (ter Braak 1986), constrained, or canonical,
correspondence analysis and its spin-off, redundancy analysis, have
been the most popular ordination methods in community ecology.
Functions <code>cca</code> and <code>rda</code> are  similar to popular
proprietary software <code>Canoco</code>, although the implementation is
completely different.  The functions are based on Legendre &amp;
Legendre's (2012) algorithm: in <code>cca</code>
Chi-square transformed data matrix is subjected to weighted linear
regression on constraining variables, and the fitted values are
submitted to correspondence analysis performed via singular value
decomposition (<code><a href="../../base/html/svd.html">svd</a></code>). Function <code>rda</code> is similar, but uses
ordinary, unweighted linear regression and unweighted SVD. Legendre &amp;
Legendre (2012), Table 11.5 (p. 650) give a skeleton of the RDA
algorithm of <span class="pkg">vegan</span>. The algorithm of CCA is similar, but
involves standardization by row and column weights.
</p>
<p>The functions can be called either with matrix-like entries for
community data and constraints, or with formula interface.  In
general, the formula interface is preferred, because it allows a
better control of the model and allows factor constraints. Some
analyses of ordination results are only possible if model was fitted
with formula (e.g., most cases of <code><a href="../../vegan/help/anova.cca.html">anova.cca</a></code>, automatic
model building).
</p>
<p>In the following sections, <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code> and <code>Z</code>, although
referred to as matrices, are more commonly data frames.
</p>
<p>In the matrix interface, the
community data matrix <code>X</code> must be given, but the other data
matrices may be omitted, and the corresponding stage of analysis is
skipped.  If matrix <code>Z</code> is supplied, its effects are removed from
the community matrix, and the residual matrix is submitted to the next
stage.  This is called partial correspondence or redundancy
analysis.  If matrix
<code>Y</code> is supplied, it is used to constrain the ordination,
resulting in constrained or canonical correspondence analysis, or
redundancy analysis.
Finally, the residual is submitted to ordinary correspondence
analysis (or principal components analysis).  If both matrices
<code>Z</code> and <code>Y</code> are missing, the
data matrix is analysed by ordinary correspondence analysis (or
principal components analysis).
</p>
<p>Instead of separate matrices, the model can be defined using a model
<code><a href="../../stats/html/formula.html">formula</a></code>.  The left hand side must be the
community data matrix (<code>X</code>).  The right hand side defines the
constraining model.
The constraints can contain ordered or unordered factors,
interactions among variables and functions of variables.  The defined
<code><a href="../../stats/html/contrasts.html">contrasts</a></code> are honoured in <code><a href="../../base/html/factor.html">factor</a></code>
variables.  The constraints can also be matrices (but not data
frames).
The formula can include a special term <code>Condition</code>
for conditioning variables (&ldquo;covariables&rdquo;) partialled out before
analysis.  So the following commands are equivalent:
<code>cca(X, Y, Z)</code>,  <code>cca(X ~ Y + Condition(Z))</code>, where <code>Y</code>
and <code>Z</code> refer to constraints and conditions matrices respectively.
</p>
<p>Constrained correspondence analysis is indeed a constrained method:
CCA does not try to display all variation in the
data, but only the part that can be explained by the used constraints.
Consequently, the results are strongly dependent on the set of
constraints and their transformations or interactions among the
constraints.  The shotgun method is to use all environmental variables
as constraints.  However, such exploratory problems are better
analysed with
unconstrained methods such as correspondence analysis
(<code><a href="../../vegan/help/decorana.html">decorana</a></code>, <code><a href="../../MASS/help/corresp.html">corresp</a></code>) or non-metric
multidimensional scaling (<code><a href="../../vegan/help/metaMDS.html">metaMDS</a></code>) and
environmental interpretation after analysis
(<code><a href="../../vegan/help/envfit.html">envfit</a></code>, <code><a href="../../vegan/help/ordisurf.html">ordisurf</a></code>).
CCA is a good choice if the user has
clear and strong <em>a priori</em> hypotheses on constraints and is not
interested in the major structure in the data set.  
</p>
<p>CCA is able to correct the curve artefact commonly found in
correspondence analysis by forcing the configuration into linear
constraints.  However, the curve artefact can be avoided only with a
low number of constraints that do not have a curvilinear relation with
each other.  The curve can reappear even with two badly chosen
constraints or a single factor.  Although the formula interface makes it
easy to include polynomial or interaction terms, such terms often
produce curved artefacts (that are difficult to interpret), these
should probably be avoided.
</p>
<p>According to folklore, <code>rda</code> should be used with &ldquo;short
gradients&rdquo; rather than <code>cca</code>. However, this is not based
on research which finds methods based on Euclidean metric as uniformly
weaker than those based on Chi-squared metric.  However, standardized
Euclidean distance may be an appropriate measures (see Hellinger
standardization in <code><a href="../../vegan/help/decostand.html">decostand</a></code> in particular).
</p>
<p>Partial CCA (pCCA; or alternatively partial RDA) can be used to remove
the effect of some
conditioning or background or random variables or
covariables before CCA proper.  In fact, pCCA compares models
<code>cca(X ~ Z)</code> and <code>cca(X ~ Y + Z)</code> and attributes their
difference to the effect of <code>Y</code> cleansed of the effect of
<code>Z</code>.  Some people have used the method for extracting
&ldquo;components of variance&rdquo; in CCA.  However, if the effect of
variables together is stronger than sum of both separately, this can
increase total Chi-square after partialling out some
variation, and give negative &ldquo;components of variance&rdquo;.  In general,
such components of &ldquo;variance&rdquo; are not to be trusted due to
interactions between two sets of variables.
</p>
<p>The functions have <code>summary</code> and <code>plot</code> methods which are
documented separately (see <code><a href="../../vegan/help/plot.cca.html">plot.cca</a></code>, <code><a href="../../vegan/help/summary.cca.html">summary.cca</a></code>).

<p>This help page describes two constrained ordination functions,
<code>cca</code> and <code>rda</code>.  A related method, distance-based
redundancy analysis (dbRDA) is described separately
(<code><a href="../../vegan/help/capscale.html">capscale</a></code>). All these functions return similar objects
(described in <code><a href="../../vegan/help/cca.object.html">cca.object</a></code>). There are numerous support
functions that can be used to access the result object. In the list
below, functions of type <code>cca</code> will handle all three constrained
ordination objects, and functions of <code>rda</code> only handle <code>rda</code>
and <code><a href="../../vegan/help/capscale.html">capscale</a></code> results.
</p>
<p>The main plotting functions are <code><a href="../../vegan/help/plot.cca.html">plot.cca</a></code> for all
methods, and <code><a href="../../vegan/help/biplot.rda.html">biplot.rda</a></code> for RDA and dbRDA.  However,
generic <span class="pkg">vegan</span> plotting functions can also handle the results.
The scores can be accessed and scaled with <code><a href="../../vegan/help/scores.cca.html">scores.cca</a></code>,
and summarized with <code><a href="../../vegan/help/summary.cca.html">summary.cca</a></code>. The eigenvalues can
be accessed with <code><a href="../../vegan/help/eigenvals.cca.html">eigenvals.cca</a></code> and the regression
coefficients for constraints with <code><a href="../../vegan/help/coef.cca.html">coef.cca</a></code>.  The
eigenvalues can be plotted with <code><a href="../../vegan/help/screeplot.cca.html">screeplot.cca</a></code>, and the
(adjusted) <i>R-squared</i> can be found with
<code><a href="../../vegan/help/RsquareAdj.rda.html">RsquareAdj.rda</a></code>. The scores can be also calculated for
new data sets with <code><a href="../../vegan/help/predict.cca.html">predict.cca</a></code> which allows adding
points to ordinations.  The values of constraints can be inferred
from ordination and community composition with
