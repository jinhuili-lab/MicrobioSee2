<h2>Permutation tests in Vegan</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>From version 2.2-0, <span class="pkg">vegan</span> has significantly improved access to
restricted permutations which brings it into line with those offered
by Canoco. The permutation designs are modelled after the permutation
schemes of Canoco 3.1 (ter Braak, 1990).
</p>
<p><span class="pkg">vegan</span> currently provides for the following features within
permutation tests:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Free permutation of <em>DATA</em>, also known as randomisation,
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Free permutation of <em>DATA</em> within the levels of a
grouping variable,
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Restricted permutations for line transects or time series,
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Permutation of groups of samples whilst retaining the
within-group ordering,
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Restricted permutations for spatial grids,
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Blocking, samples are never permuted <em>between</em> blocks,
and
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Split-plot designs, with permutation of whole plots, split
plots, or both.
</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Above, we use <em>DATA</em> to mean either the observed data themselves
or some function of the data, for example the residuals of an
ordination model in the presence of covariables.
</p>
<p>These capabilities are provided by functions from the <span class="pkg">permute</span>
package. The user can request a particular type of permutation by
supplying the <code>permutations</code> argument of a function with an
object returned by <code><a href="../../permute/html/how.html">how</a></code>, which defines how samples should
be permuted. Alternatively, the user can simply specify the required
number of permutations and a simple randomisation procedure will be
performed. Finally, the user can supply a matrix of permutations (with
number of rows equal to the number of permutations and number of
columns equal to the number of observations in the data) and
<span class="pkg">vegan</span> will use these permutations instead of generating new
permutations.
</p>
<p>The majority of functions in <span class="pkg">vegan</span> allow for the full range of
possibilities outlined above. Exceptions include
<code><a href="../../vegan/help/kendall.post.html">kendall.post</a></code> and <code><a href="../../vegan/help/kendall.global.html">kendall.global</a></code>.
</p>
<p>The Null hypothesis for the first two types of permutation test listed
above assumes free exchangeability of <em>DATA</em> (within the levels
of the grouping variable, if specified). Dependence between
observations, such as that which arises due to spatial or temporal
autocorrelation, or more-complicated experimental designs, such as
split-plot designs, violates this fundamental assumption of the test
and requires more complex restricted permutation test designs. It is
these designs that are available via the <span class="pkg">permute</span> package and to
which <span class="pkg">vegan</span> provides access from version 2.2-0 onwards.
</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated in the help pages for specific functions,
permutation tests in <span class="pkg">vegan</span> all follow the same format/structure:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>An appropriate test statistic is chosen. Which statistic is
chosen should be described on the help pages for individual
functions.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>The value of the test statistic is evaluate for the observed
data and analysis/model and recorded. Denote this value
<i>x[0]</i>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <em>DATA</em> are randomly permuted according to one of the
above schemes, and the value of the test statistic for this
permutation is evaluated and recorded.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Step 3 is repeated a total of <i>n</i> times, where <i>n</i> is
the number of permutations requested. Denote these values as
<i>x[i]</i>, where <i>{i = 1, &hellip;, n}.</i>
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Count the number of values of the test statistic,
<i>x[i]</i>, in the Null distribution that are as extreme as
test statistic for the observed data <i>x[0]</i>. Denote this
count as <i>N</i>.
</p>
<p>We use the phrase <em>as extreme</em> to include cases where a
two-sided test is performed and large negative values of the test
statistic should be considered.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>The permutation p-value is computed as
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>(N + 1) / (n + 1)</i></p>

</li></ol>

<p>The above description illustrates why the default number of
permutations specified in <span class="pkg">vegan</span> functions takes values of 199 or
999 for example. Pretty <em>p</em> values are achieved because the
<i>+ 1</i> in the denominator results in division by 200 or 1000, for
the 199 or 999 random permutations used in the test.
</p>
<p>The simple intuition behind the presence of <i>+ 1</i> in the numerator
and denominator is that these represent the inclusion of the observed
value of the statistic in the Null distribution (e.g. Manly 2006).
Phipson &amp; Smyth (2010) present a more compelling explanation for the
inclusion of <i>+ 1</i> in the numerator and denominator of the
<em>p</em> value calculation.
</p>
<p>Fisher (1935) had in mind that a permutation test would involve
enumeration of all possible permutations of the data yielding an exact
test. However, doing this complete enumeration may not be feasible in
practice owing to the potentially vast number of arrangements of the
data, even in modestly-sized data sets with free permutation of
samples. As a result we evaluate the <em>p</em> value as the tail
probability of the Null distribution of the test statistic directly
from the random sample of possible permutations. Phipson &amp; Smyth
(2010) show that the naive calculation of the permutation <em>p</em>
value is
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>p = N / n</i></p>

<p>which leads to an invalid test with incorrect type I error rate. They
go on to show that by replacing the unknown tail probability (the
<em>p</em> value) of the Null distribution with the biased estimator
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>p = (N + 1) / (n + 1)</i></p>

<p>that the positive bias induced is of just the right size to
account for the  uncertainty in the estimation of the tail probability
from the set of randomly sampled permutations to yield a test with the
correct type I error rate.
</p>
<p>The estimator described above is correct for the situation where
permutations of the data are samples randomly <em>without</em>
replacement. This is not strictly what happens in <span class="pkg">vegan</span> because
permutations are drawn pseudo-randomly independent of one
another. Note that the actual chance of this happening is practice is
small but the functions in <span class="pkg">permute</span> do not guarantee to generate
a unique set of permutations unless complete enumeration of
permutations is requested. This is not feasible for all but the
smallest of data sets or restrictive of permutation designs, but in
such cases the chance of drawing a set of permutations with repeats is
lessened as the sample size, and thence the size of set of all
possible permutations, increases.
</p>
<p>Under the situation of sampling permutations with replacement then,
the tail probability <i>p</i> calculated from the biased estimator
described above is somewhat <strong>conservative</strong>, being too large by
an amount that depends on the number of possible values that the test
statistic can take under permutation of the data (Phipson &amp; Smyth,
2010). This represents a slight loss of statistical power for the
conservative <em>p</em> value calculation used here. However, unless
sample sizes are small and the the permutation design such that the
set of values that the test statistic can take is also small, this
loss of power is unlikely to be critical.
</p>
<p>The minimum achievable p-value is
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>p[min] = 1 / (n + 1)</i></p>

<p>and hence depends on the number of permutations evaluated. However,
one cannot simply increase the number of permutations (<i>n</i>) to
achieve a potentially lower p-value unless the number of observations
available permits such a number of permutations. This is unlikely to
be a problem for all but the smallest data sets when free permutation
(randomisation) is valid, but in restricted permutation designs with a
low number of observations, there may not be as many unique
permutations of the data as you might desire to reach the required
level of significance.
</p>
<p>It is currently the responsibility of the user to determine the total
number of possible permutations for their <em>DATA</em>. The number of
possible permutations allowed under the specified design can be
calculated using <code><a href="../../permute/help/numPerms.html">numPerms</a></code> from the
<span class="pkg">permute</span> package. Heuristics employed within the
<code><a href="../../permute/help/shuffleSet.html">shuffleSet</a></code> function used by <span class="pkg">vegan</span> can be
triggered to generate the entire set of permutations instead of a
random set. The settings controlling the triggering of the complete
enumeration step are contained within a permutation design created
using <code>link[permute]{how}</code> and can be set by the user. See
<code><a href="../../permute/help/how.html">how</a></code> for details.
</p>
<p>Limits on the total number of permutations of <em>DATA</em> are more
severe in temporally or spatially ordered data or experimental designs
with low replication. For example, a time series of <i>n = 100</i>
observations has just 100 possible permutations <strong>including</strong> the
observed ordering.
</p>
<p>In situations where only a low number of permutations is possible due
to the nature of <em>DATA</em> or the experimental design, enumeration
of all permutations becomes important and achievable computationally.
</p>
<p>Above, we have provided only a brief overview of the capabilities of
<span class="pkg">vegan</span> and <span class="pkg">permute</span>. To get the best out of the new
functionality and for details on how to set up permutation designs
using <code><a href="../../permute/help/how.html">how</a></code>, consult the vignette
<em>Restricted permutations; using the permute package</em> supplied
with <span class="pkg">permute</span> and accessible via <code>vignette("permutations",
  package = "permute").</code>

<h3>Random Number Generation</h3>

<p>The permutations are based on the random number generator provided
by <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>. This may change in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> releases and change the permutations
and <span class="pkg">vegan</span> test results. One such change was in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> release
3.6.0. The new version is clearly better for permutation tests and
you should use it. However, if you need to reproduce old results,
you can set the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> random number generator to a previous version
with <code><a href="../../base/html/Random.html">RNGversion</a></code>.
