<h2>Stepacross as Flexible Shortest Paths or Extended Dissimilarities </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function <code>stepacross</code> tries to replace dissimilarities with
shortest paths stepping across intermediate 
sites while regarding dissimilarities above a threshold as missing
data (<code>NA</code>). With <code>path = "shortest"</code> this is the flexible shortest
path (Williamson 1978, Bradfield &amp; Kenkel 1987),
and with <code>path = "extended"</code> an
approximation known as extended dissimilarities (De'ath 1999).
The use of <code>stepacross</code> should improve the ordination with high
beta diversity, when there are many sites with no species in common.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

stepacross(dis, path = "shortest", toolong = 1, trace = TRUE, ...)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Williamson (1978) suggested using flexible shortest paths to estimate
dissimilarities between sites which have nothing in common, or no shared
species. With <code>path = "shortest"</code> function <code>stepacross</code>
replaces dissimilarities that are
<code>toolong</code> or longer with <code>NA</code>, and tries to find shortest
paths between all sites using remaining dissimilarities. Several
dissimilarity indices are semi-metric which means that they do not
obey the triangle inequality <i>d[ij] &lt;=
    d[ik] + d[kj]</i>, and shortest path algorithm can replace these
dissimilarities as well, even when they are shorter than
<code>toolong</code>. 
</p>
<p>De'ath (1999) suggested a simplified method known as extended
dissimilarities, which are calculated with <code>path = "extended"</code>. 
In this method, dissimilarities that are
<code>toolong</code> or longer are first made <code>NA</code>, and then the function
tries to replace these <code>NA</code> dissimilarities with a path through
single stepping stone points. If not all <code>NA</code> could be 
replaced with one pass, the function will make new passes with updated
dissimilarities as long as
all <code>NA</code> are replaced with extended dissimilarities. This mean
that in the second and further passes, the remaining <code>NA</code>
dissimilarities are allowed to have more than one stepping stone site,
but previously replaced dissimilarities are not updated. Further, the
function does not consider dissimilarities shorter than <code>toolong</code>,
although some of these could be replaced with a shorter path in
semi-metric indices, and used as a part of other paths. In optimal
cases, the extended dissimilarities are equal to shortest paths, but
they may be longer.  
</p>
<p>As an alternative to defining too long dissimilarities with parameter
<code>toolong</code>, the input dissimilarities can contain <code>NA</code>s. If
<code>toolong</code> is zero or negative, the function does not make any
dissimilarities into <code>NA</code>. If there are no <code>NA</code>s in the
input  and <code>toolong = 0</code>, <code>path = "shortest"</code>
will find shorter paths for semi-metric indices, and <code>path = "extended"</code> 
will do nothing. Function <code><a href="../../vegan/help/no.shared.html">no.shared</a></code> can be
used to set dissimilarities to <code>NA</code>.
</p>
<p>If the data are disconnected or there is no path between all points,
the result will
contain <code>NA</code>s and a warning is issued. Several methods cannot
handle <code>NA</code> dissimilarities, and this warning should be taken
seriously. Function <code><a href="../../vegan/help/distconnected.html">distconnected</a></code> can be used to find
connected groups and remove rare outlier observations or groups of
observations.
</p>
<p>Alternative <code>path = "shortest"</code> uses Dijkstra's method for
finding flexible shortest paths, implemented as priority-first search
for dense graphs (Sedgewick 1990). Alternative <code>path = "extended"</code> 
follows De'ath (1999), but implementation is simpler
than in his code.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Function returns an object of class <code>dist</code> with extended
dissimilarities (see functions <code><a href="../../vegan/help/vegdist.html">vegdist</a></code> and
<code><a href="../../stats/html/dist.html">dist</a></code>). 
The value of <code>path</code> is appended to the <code>method</code> attribute.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The function changes the original dissimilarities, and not all
like this. It may be best to  use  the
function only when you really <em>must</em>:  extremely high
beta diversity where a large proportion of dissimilarities are at their
upper limit (no species in common). 
</p>
<p>Semi-metric indices vary in their degree of violating the triangle
inequality. Morisita and Horn&ndash;Morisita indices of
<code><a href="../../vegan/help/vegdist.html">vegdist</a></code> may be very strongly semi-metric, and shortest
paths can change these indices very much. Mountford index violates
basic rules of dissimilarities: non-identical sites have zero
dissimilarity if species composition of the poorer site is a subset of
the richer. With Mountford index, you can find three sites <i>i, j,
    k</i> so that <i>d[ik] = 0</i> and <i>d[jk] =
    0</i>, but <i>d[ij] &gt; 0</i>. The results of <code>stepacross</code>
on Mountford index can be very weird. If <code>stepacross</code> is needed,
it is best to try to use it with more metric indices only.
