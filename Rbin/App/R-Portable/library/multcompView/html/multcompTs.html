<h2>&quot;T&quot; depiction of undifferentiated classes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Convert a logical vector or a vector of p-values or a correlation or
distance matrix into a matrix with an associated visual display to show
whether the differences between items exceed a threshold.  Designed for use
with the output of functions like TukeyHSD, diststats, simint, simtest,
csimint, csimtestmultcomp, friedmanmc, kruskalmcpgirmess.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
multcompTs(x, compare = "&lt;", threshold = 0.05, sep = ".")
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>One of the following: (1) A square, symmetric matrix with row
names.  (2) A vector with hyphenated names, which identify individual items
or factor levels after &quot;strsplit(..., '-')&quot;.  (3) An object of class &quot;dist&quot;.
</p>
<p>If x (or x[1]) is not already of class &quot;logical&quot;, it is replaced with
do.call(compare, list(x, threshold)), which by default converts numbers
(typically p-values) less than 0.05 to TRUE and everything else to FALSE.
If x is a matrix, its diagonal must be or must convert to FALSE.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>compare</code></td>
<td>
<p>function or binary operator; not used if class(x) is
&quot;logical&quot;.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>Second (reference) argument to &quot;compare&quot;.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sep</code></td>
<td>
<p>Concatenation character for names of objects with identical
similarity / dissimilarity patterns.  The output of multcompTs is matrix for
which the number of rows = (number of columns + number of uses of the &quot;sep&quot;
character).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Produces a matrix of class &quot;multcompTs&quot;, describing the &quot;undifferentiated
classes&quot; that identify the other factor levels or items that are not
distinct or not significantly different from the &quot;base&quot; of the &quot;T&quot;; if two
or more levels have the same pattern of significant differences, the two are
combined into one &quot;T&quot; with two &quot;bases&quot;.  The resulting T's are similar to
the &quot;undifferentiated classes&quot; discussed by Donaghue (2004).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class &quot;multcompTs&quot;, which is a matrix of values -1, 0,
1, with one row for each level compared and one column for each &quot;T&quot;, read as
follows: 1 = base of the &quot;T&quot; represented by that column, 0 = level(s) not
significantly different, and (-1) = levels(s) significantly different.  If
two or more levels have the same pattern of significant and insignificant
differences, they are combined into a single column that can be represented
by a &quot;T&quot; with multiple bases.  The column name will be a character string
concatenating all row names with &quot;1&quot; in that column separated by the &quot;sep&quot;
character.  Thus, the matrix should have as many 1's as it has rows.  Also,
the lower triangular portion should have as many &quot;-1's&quot; as there are &quot;TRUE&quot;
(e.g., significant) differences among the comparisons.
