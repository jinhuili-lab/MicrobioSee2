Version 1.1
    o Fixed minor bugs
    o New feature to draw a Venn diagram using a DNF
      (disjunctive normal form) notation
    o QCA type objects can have transparency based on the inclusion score
    o Parameters for borders can have lengths, recycled to the length of zones
    
    
      The following were all suggested by Tom Wenseleers (with thanks):
      
    o The plot window is now forced to a square, using asp = 1
    o New venn shapes for 4 and 5 sets, to maximize the space for intersections
    o Default color styles, and associated border colors
    o Variable text size for the intersection labels and for the set names
    
    
Version 1.0
    o First version of the package
