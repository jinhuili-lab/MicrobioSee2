<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The argument <code>x</code> can be either:<br />
- a single number of sets, between 1 and 7<br />
- a metacommand (character) to draw custom intersection zones<br />
- a list, containing values for the different sets: each component is a set,
and only up to 7 components are processed.<br />
- a dataset of boolean values.<br />
</p>
<p>A &quot;zone&quot; is a union of set intersections. There are exactly <code>2^k</code> intersections
in a Venn diagram, where <code>k</code> is the number of sets. To highlight an entire set,
we need a union of all possible intersections which form that set.
</p>
<p>For example, in a 3 sets diagram, the (overall) first set is composed by four
intersections:<br />
<code>100</code> for what is in the first set but outside sets 2 and outside set 3<br />
<code>101</code> for the intersection between sets 1 and 3, outside set 2<br />
<code>110</code> for the intersection between sets 1 and 2, outside set 3<br />
<code>111</code> for the intersection between all three sets.
</p>
<p>A meta-language can be used to define these intersections, using the values of
<code>1</code> for what is inside the set, <code>0</code> for what is outside the set, and
<code>-</code> when its either inside or outside of the set.
</p>
<p>The command <code>"1--"</code> is translated as &quot;display only the first, entire set&quot; is
equivalent with the union of the four intersections <code>"100 + 101 + 110 + 111"</code>.
</p>
<p>The parameter <code>setnames</code> should have the same length as the number of sets
specified by the parameter <code>x</code>.
</p>
<p>When the parameter <code>x</code> is used as a metacommand, the number of sets is calculated
as the number of characters in each intersection of the metacommand. One such
character command is <code>"100 + 101 + 110 + 111"</code> or <code>"1--"</code>, and all
intersections have exactly three characters.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to use a regular, disjunctive normal form, like <code>"A"</code>,
which is equivalent with <code>"Abc + AbC + ABc + ABC"</code>. This uses (internally) the
function <code>translate()</code> from package <code>QCAGUI</code>.
</p>
<p>Argument <code>counts</code> is used when <code>x</code> is a list or a dataframe. When a list,
it counts the number of common values for each intersection. When <code>x</code> is a
dataframe (comprised of exclusively boolean values 0 and 1), it counts the number of
similar rows, for each intersection. <code>counts</code> is activated by default when <code>x</code>
is a list or a dataframe.
</p>
<p>The argument <code>snames</code> establishes names for the different sets, or in its absence
it is taken from <code>LETTERS</code>. When <code>x</code> isa list or a dataframe, <code>snames</code> is
taken from their names. The length of the <code>snames</code> indicates the total number of sets.
</p>
<p>The argument <code>ellipse</code> differentiates between two types of diagrams for 4 and 5 sets.
The idea is to allow for as much space as possible for each intersection (also as equal
as possible) and that is impossible if preserving the shape of an ellipse. The default is
to create large space for the intersections, but users who prefer an ellipse might want
to set this argument to <code>TRUE</code>.
</p>
<p>Colors to fill the desired zones (or entire sets) can be supplied via the argument
<code>zcolor</code> (the default is <code>"bw"</code> black and white, which means no colors at all).
Users can either chose the predefined color style, using <code>zcolor = "style"</code>, or supply
a vector of custom colors for each zone. If only one custom color is supplied, it will
be recycled for all zones.
</p>
<p>When using <code>zcolor = "style"</code>, any other additional arguments for the borders are
ignored.
</p>
<p>A different set of predefined colors is used, when argument <code>x</code> is a QCA type object
(a truth table, either from a class <code>tt</code> or from a class <code>qca</code>). If custom colors
are provided via <code>zcolor</code>, it should have a length of 3 colors: the first for the 
absence of the outcome (<code>0</code>), the second for the presence of the outcome (<code>1</code>),
and the third for the contradictions (<code>C</code>). Remainders have no color, by default.
</p>
<p>Via <code>...</code>, users can specify additional parameters, mainly for the outer borders
of the sets, as specified by <code>par</code>. All of them are feeded to the function
<code>lines()</code> which is responsible with the borders.
</p>
<p>For up to 3 sets, the shapes can be circular. For more than 3 sets, the shape cannot be
circular, in the case of 4 and 5 sets they are ellipses. For more than 5 sets the
shapes cannot be continous (they might be monotone, but not continous). The 7 sets
diagram is called &quot;Adelaide&quot; (Ruskey, 2005).
</p>
<p>The most challenging diagram is the one with 6 sets, where for many years it was
thought a Venn diagram didn't even exist. All diagrams are symetric, except for the
one with 6 sets, where some of the sets have different shapes. The diagram in this
package is an adaptation from Mamakani, K., Myrvold W. and F. Ruskey (2011),
