<h2>Display a hierarchical breakdown of disjunct categories</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Display a data frame in which the values in each successive
column represent subcategories of the previous column as stacked
rectangles.</p>

<pre>
 sizetree(x,left=0,top,right=1,lastcenter=NA,showval=TRUE,showcount=TRUE,
  stacklabels=TRUE,firstcall=TRUE,col=NULL,border=NA,toplab=NULL,base.cex=1,
  ...)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><span class="samp">sizetree</span> displays disjunct hierarchical categories as stacked rectangles.
It accepts a data frame in which the values in the first column represent
categories, the values in the second column represent subcategories of the
first column, and so on. The first column will be displayed as a stack of
rectangles, the height of each proportional to the count for each category.
Each substack of rectangles in the second stack will represent the breakdown
of counts for its superordinate category and so on through the columns.
Empty categories are ignored and NAs will produce gaps, which will propagate
across subsequent stacks.
</p>
<p>The user can simply pass the data frame, which should only contain columns that
are hierarchical categories (example 1). The colors will probably not be ideal.
The user can pass the same colors for the all levels (example 2). If this is
done, <span class="samp">sizetree</span> will try to match colors to categories when
the number of categories is diminishing (e.g. some levels are missing in the
sub-categories) and the columns of <span class="samp">x</span> are factors with the same levels in
the same order. This will work if the category labels are the same in each level,
but remember to add the names to the colors before passing them to the function.
This will not work if there are more categories in the lower levels. If <span class="samp">col</span>
is a list, this is not done, and the user will have to work out the correct colors
for each level. This is particularly important when the category labels and the
number of categories is different in different levels (example 3).
</p>
<p>In some sizetrees, the subcategory counts are very low compared to the overall
number of data objects. This results in rectangles that are very thin vertically.
One way to get better legibility of the labels is to use dark colors for the
rectangles, so that the labels are white, and no borders (set <span class="samp">border</span> to NA).
The user can also select only part of the data frame <span class="samp">x</span> to expand sections
of the sizetree as in the last example.
</p>
<p>The labels are sized to fit the vertical extent of the bars. However, it is
possible that the labels may extend horizontally beyond the bar(s). The
<span class="samp">base.cex</span> argument can be used to shrink the labels if this happens.
Remember that <span class="samp">base.cex</span> will shrink all the labels, not just the ones
that are too wide.
</p>
<p>The <span class="samp">firstcall</span> argument is necessary for the function to initialize the
plot, as each breakdown involves a recursive call. If it is changed, the best
that can be expected is an uninformative plot.
