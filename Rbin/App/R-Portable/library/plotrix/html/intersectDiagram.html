<h2>Display set intersections</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Display set intersections as rows of rectangles.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
 intersectDiagram(x,pct=FALSE,show.nulls=FALSE,xnames=NULL,sep="+",

</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list containing as many numeric vectors as there are sets. The
first vector contains the counts or percentages of the elements that are
only in one set, the next vector contains the counts or percentages of 
elements that are in two sets and so on. A matrix of set membership
indicators or a two column matrix of object identifiers and attribute
identifiers can be passed - see Details.</p>

number of entities.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>show.nulls</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to display the number of original objects that 
are not members of any set. Any value that is not NA will become the 
label for this category.</p>

<td>
<p>Optional user supplied names for the set categories (see
Details).</p>

<td>
<p>The separator to use between category names (see Details).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>mar</code></td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><span class="samp">intersectDiagram</span> displays rows of optionally colored rectangles that
represent the intersections of set memberships (attributes) of a set of objects.
The topmost row represents the intersections of the fewest sets, and
succeeding rows represent the intersections of more sets. If there were objects
in the original data set that were not members of any set, any percentages
calculated will reflect this. By setting <span class="samp">show.nulls</span> to TRUE, the counts
or percentages of such objects will be displayed below the intersections over
an empty rectangle scaled to the count or percentage.
</p>
<p>Important - If the <span class="samp">all.intersections</span> argument is TRUE, all intersections
will be displayed, whether empty or not (see the example). This is mostly for
demonstration purposes, and if the number of sets is large, is likely to produce
a very messy diagram. Similarly, sets with large numbers of
intersections that are populated will require very large displays to be readable,
even if there are small numbers in the intersections. If you would like to see
this in action, pass the data frame <span class="samp">setdf</span> in the <a href="../../plotrix/help/categoryReshape.html">categoryReshape</a>
example to <span class="samp">intersectDiagram</span> with <span class="samp">all.intersections</span> TRUE.
</p>
<p><span class="samp">intersectDiagram</span> does not attempt to display the set intersections as
a pattern of overlapping geometric figures, but rather the relative numbers of
objects sharing each intersection. More than three intersecting sets generally
produce a complex and difficult to interpret Venn diagram, and this provides an
alternative way to display the size of intersections between larger numbers
of sets.
</p>
<p><span class="samp">intersectDiagram</span> now allows the user to display only part of the 
set intersections, which is useful for analyzing very complex intersections.
This is controlled by the <span class="samp">include</span> argument. This defaults to all sets or 
attributes when <span class="samp">include=NULL</span>. If one or more of the labels of the sets or 
attributes is passed, only the intersections containing those labels will be 
displayed. See examples 2 and 3 below.
</p>
<p>Each set (attribute) is assigned a color if <span class="samp">col</span> is not NA. <span class="samp">rainbow</span>
is called if <span class="samp">col</span> is NULL, otherwise the colors passed are used. For each
intersection, the colors representing the sets intersecting are included in
the rectangle.
</p>
<p>The strings displayed on each rectangle are taken from the argument
<span class="samp">xnames</span> unless that is NULL, then the <span class="samp">names</span> of the intersectList
object passed as <span class="samp">x</span> or returned from the call to <span class="samp">makeIntersectList</span>.
</p>
<p>If a matrix or data frame of set membership indicators is passed as <span class="samp">x</span>,
it will be passed to <a href="../../plotrix/help/makeIntersectList.html">makeIntersectList</a> for conversion. Each column must
represent a set, and the values in the columns must be 0 or 1, or FALSE or TRUE.
Similarly, if a matrix or data frame in which the first column is object
identifiers and the second column is attributes, this will be passed to
<span class="samp">makeIntersectList</span>.
</p>
<p>The spacing between the largest rectangles is controlled by <span class="samp">minspacing</span>.
<span class="samp">minspacing</span> is in units of object counts and defaults to 0.1 times the
largest number of objects in an intersection. When the number of objects in
different intersections at a given level varies widely, the labels of
intersections with few objects may overlap if they are wide relative to the
rectangle representing the number of objects. This can be corrected by
passing a <span class="samp">minspacing</span> argument that will increase the space between
rectangles and/or decreasing the character size of the labels. If the labels
for each set are relatively long, setting <span class="samp">namesep="\n"</span> may help. Note 
that if a different separator is passed, that separator must be explicitly
passed in any subsequent calls using the same <span class="samp">intersectList</span> object - see
examples 1 to 3 below.
