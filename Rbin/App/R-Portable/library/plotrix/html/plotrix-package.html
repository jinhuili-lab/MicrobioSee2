<p>The plotrix package is intended to provide a method for getting many sorts of
specialized plots quickly, yet allow easy customization of those plots
without learning a great deal of specialized syntax. There are three major
aims that can be represented as follows:
</p>
<p>Fast foods
</p>
<p>Think of plotrix as a graphics vending machine or fast graphics cafe. You walk
in, make your choice and get your lunch. It may not be exactly the lunch you
want, but you do get a pretty good lunch, fast. You can get junk food or
health food, you make the choice.
</p>
<p>Hot rods
</p>
<p>You can customize plotrix as much as you want. Like the ageing machinery that
is usually bolted into hot rods, the base graphics package is fairly easy to
understand. plotrix is modular. You can create a frame for your plot, then
you can add whatever bits you like to it instead of just taking the default
plot that is available. You can have wide wheels and chromed exhaust pipes if
you want.
</p>
<p>No black boxes
</p>
<p>If you want to go from pushing the fast food button to hot rodding, it's not
hard. The source code in the functions is written to be understood. If
something goes wrong, you can usually find where it happened right away and
work on it. This means that you can learn about how the functions do what
they do rather than just what they do. So that's how to write recursive
functions in R!
</p>
<p>Because plotrix encourages users to learn how it works, you usually begin to
do so pretty quickly. Users often decide to write their own versions of
plotrix functions and sometimes they contribute the results back into plotrix.
You may find that you like other graphics systems like grid or lattice better.
That's great, because one idea behind plotrix is that if you get into R and
can get things done quickly and easily, you'll stick with it and soon want to
get things done your way.
