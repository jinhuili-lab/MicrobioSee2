  \itemize{
    \item Supported UCRT on Windows, thanks to Tomas Kalibera and Uwe Ligges.
  }
}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.9-4}{
  \itemize{
    \item Fixed the configure script, thanks to Prof. Brian Ripley.
    \item Fixed the issue of not exporting the initialization function on Windows.
  }
}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.9-3}{
  \itemize{
    \item Added a new search path in the configure script
          (\href{https://github.com/yixuan/sysfonts/issues/17}{sysfonts#17}).
    \item Fixed a font rendering bug
          (\href{https://github.com/yixuan/showtext/issues/52}{#52}).
  }
}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.9-2}{
  \itemize{
    \item Test the availability of Cairo-based devices before setting \code{type = "cairo"}
          in the vignette, thanks to Prof. Brian Ripley
  }
}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.9-1}{
  \itemize{
    \item Fixed a bug that introduced random font rendering failures,
          reported by Carson Sievert
          (\href{https://github.com/yixuan/showtext/issues/43}{#43})
  }
}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.9}{
  \itemize{
    \item Refactored internal code for cleaner organization of device data
    \item Fixed the bug that device would not be properly restored by \code{showtext_end()}
          if \code{showtext_begin()} was called more than once
    \item \pkg{showtext} can now properly handle multiple graphics devices. For example,
          the following code gives error in previous versions:
          \preformatted{
          library(showtext)

          png("~/1.png")
          showtext_begin()
          
          pdf("~/2.pdf")
          showtext_begin()
          showtext_end()
          dev.off()
          
          showtext_end()  # gives error in previous version
          dev.off()}
          The situation above is not common in using \pkg{showtext}, but this version
          has fixed this potential bug
    \item \pkg{showtext} now supports replaying a recorded plot via \code{recordPlot()}
          and \code{replayPlot()}, thanks to Carson Sievert
          (\href{https://github.com/yixuan/showtext/pull/40}{#40},
          \href{https://github.com/yixuan/showtext/pull/42}{#42})
    \item As a consequence of the previous point, \pkg{showtext} now works well with
          the RStudio graphics device
          (\href{https://github.com/yixuan/showtext/issues/7}{#7},
          \href{https://github.com/yixuan/showtext/issues/31}{#31})
  }
}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.8-1}{
  \itemize{
    \item Fixed a bug that the C function \code{showtext_cairo_device_bitmap()}
          was not exported on Windows
          (\href{https://github.com/yixuan/showtext/issues/35}{#35})
  }
}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.8}{
  \itemize{
    \item Fixed a resolution issue for bitmap graphics devices in the \pkg{Cairo} package
          (\href{https://github.com/yixuan/showtext/issues/33}{#33})
    \item Updated the list of supported bitmap graphics devices
    \item Updated the vignette and the README file to introduce a workaround for the
          RStudioGD issue (\href{https://github.com/yixuan/showtext/issues/7}{#7})
  }
}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.7-1}{
  \itemize{
    \item Fixed an issue for the MS Gothic font
          (\href{https://github.com/yixuan/showtext/issues/29}{#29})
  }
}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.7}{
  \itemize{
    \item Now a new rule for the default font family is made: if the user does not
          specify a font family, then the default one will be used to
          render the text. If all characters in the string have Unicodes smaller than 1024,
          then the default font family is "sans"; otherwise "wqy-microhei" is used
    \item Fixed the \code{VignetteBuilder} entry in the \code{DESCRIPTION} file
          according to CRAN's policy
  }
}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.6}{

          (\href{https://github.com/yixuan/showtext/issues/20}{#20})
    \item Updated the README and vignette to introduce some new features
  }
}

  }
}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.5}{
  \itemize{
    \item All previous API functions now have aliases replacing the dots
          with underscores in the function names, for example \code{showtext_auto()}
          is equivalent to \code{showtext.auto()}. The "underscore" naming is
          preferred, and the "dot" version will be gradually \strong{deprecated}
    \item Fixed PROTECT errors detected by CRAN
    \item Registered native routines per CRAN's policy
  }
}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.4-6}{

}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.4-2}{
  \itemize{
    \item When the requested font family is not found, the program will give
          warnings, and then the default font will be used
          (previously this was done silently)
  }
}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.4-1}{
  \itemize{
    \item Fixed bugs in calculating metric information of characters
  }
}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.4}{
  \itemize{
    \item New function \code{shwotext.auto()} to automatically call
          \code{showtext.begin()} in any newly opened graphics devices,
          saving a lot of typing
    \item Better visual effect for a number of bitmap and on-screen devices
          including \code{png()}, \code{jpeg()}, \code{tiff()}, \code{bmp()},
          \code{x11()} and \code{windows()}. For these devices we use
          raster image rather than polygons to draw text
    \item Options setting has been moved to a new function \code{showtext.opts()}
          (previously \code{nseg} is in \code{showtext.begin()})
