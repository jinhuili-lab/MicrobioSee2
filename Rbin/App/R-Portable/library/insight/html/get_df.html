<h2>Extract degrees of freedom</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Estimate or extract residual or model-based degrees of freedom
from regression models.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
get_df(x, ...)

## Default S3 method:
get_df(x, type = "residual", verbose = TRUE, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<p>Can be <code>"residual"</code>, <code>"wald"</code>, <code>"normal"</code>, or
<code>"model"</code>. <code>"analytical"</code> is an alias for <code>"residual"</code>.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>"residual"</code> (aka <code>"analytical"</code>) returns the residual degrees of
freedom, which usually is what <code><a href="../../stats/help/df.residual.html">stats::df.residual()</a></code> returns. If a
model object has no method to extract residual degrees of freedom, these
are calculated as <code>n-p</code>, i.e. the number of observations minus the number
of estimated parameters. If residual degrees of freedom cannot be extracted
by either approach, returns <code>Inf</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"wald"</code> returns residual (aka analytical) degrees of freedom for models
with t-statistic, <code>1</code> for models with Chi-squared statistic, and <code>Inf</code> for
all other models. Also returns <code>Inf</code> if residual degrees of freedom cannot
be extracted.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"normal"</code> always returns <code>Inf</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"model"</code> returns model-based degrees of freedom, i.e. the number of
(estimated) parameters.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> For mixed models, can also be <code>"ml1"</code> (approximation of degrees of freedom
based on a &quot;m-l-1&quot; heuristic as suggested by <em>Elff et al. 2019</em>) or
<code>"betwithin"</code>, and for models of class <code>merMod</code>, <code>type</code> can also be
<code>"satterthwaite"</code> or <code>"kenward-roger"</code>. See 'Details'.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Usually, when degrees of freedom are required to calculate p-values or
confidence intervals, <code>type = "wald"</code> is likely to be the best choice in
most cases.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Degrees of freedom for mixed models</strong>
</p>
<p>Inferential statistics (like p-values, confidence intervals and
standard errors) may be biased in mixed models when the number of clusters
is small (even if the sample size of level-1 units is high). In such cases
it is recommended to approximate a more accurate number of degrees of freedom
for such inferential statistics (see <em>Li and Redden 2015</em>).
</p>
<p><em>m-l-1 degrees of freedom</em>
</p>
<p>The <em>m-l-1</em> heuristic is an approach that uses a t-distribution with fewer
degrees of freedom. In particular for repeated measure designs (longitudinal
data analysis), the m-l-1 heuristic is likely to be more accurate than simply
using the residual or infinite degrees of freedom, because <code>get_df(type = "ml1")</code>
returns different degrees of freedom for within-cluster and between-cluster
effects. Note that the &quot;m-l-1&quot; heuristic is not applicable (or at least less
accurate) for complex multilevel designs, e.g. with cross-classified clusters.
In such cases, more accurate approaches like the Kenward-Roger approximation
is recommended. However, the &quot;m-l-1&quot; heuristic also applies to generalized
mixed models, while approaches like Kenward-Roger or Satterthwaite are limited
to linear mixed models only.
</p>
<p><em>Between-within degrees of freedom</em>
</p>
<p>The Between-within denominator degrees of freedom approximation is, similar
to the &quot;m-l-1&quot; heuristic, recommended in particular for (generalized) linear
mixed models with repeated measurements (longitudinal design).
<code>get_df(type = "betwithin")</code> implements a heuristic based on the between-within
approach, i.e. this type returns different degrees of freedom for within-cluster
and between-cluster effects. Note that this implementation does not return
exactly the same results as shown in <em>Li and Redden 2015</em>, but similar.
</p>
<p><em>Satterthwaite and Kenward-Rogers degrees of freedom</em>
</p>
<p>Unlike simpler approximation heuristics like the &quot;m-l-1&quot; rule (<code>type = "ml1"</code>),
the Satterthwaite or Kenward-Rogers approximation is also applicable in more
complex multilevel designs. However, the &quot;m-l-1&quot; or &quot;between-within&quot; heuristics
also apply to generalized mixed models, while approaches like Kenward-Roger
or Satterthwaite are limited to linear mixed models only.
